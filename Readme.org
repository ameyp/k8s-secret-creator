** Purpose

This repository creates a binary and a docker image, both of which can be used for creating an Opaque secret in the same namespace that the binary runs in.

** Prerequisites

The =ServiceAccount= used for running the pod with this binary must have authorization to create, list and delete secrets. This can be accomplished as follows, where =secret-test= is the name of the =ServiceAccount=:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
kind: ServiceAccount
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: secret-test
---
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: secret-test
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["*"]
---
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: secret-test
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: secret-test
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: secret-test
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Both of the following environment variables must be set:

- =SECRET_NAME=: The name of the secret to be created.
- =SECRET_FILE=: The name of the file that contains the secret's contents in YAML format.

  The =SECRET_FILE= is treated as a simple key-value YAML file with no nesting, so if your YAML is more complicated, the binary might fail and fall over.
